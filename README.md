# Login-System-Node-JS-Express-EJS

This project is a Node.js and Express-based web application that offers a simple login system. The code includes a configuration that sets up a server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port. Static assets, such as images and stylesheets, are loaded using the express.static middleware. The application makes use of EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine to render views on the client side. The main page of the application (/) renders a view template called base.ejs. The template includes a Bootstrap-styled login form that users can use to authenticate their credentials. Additionally, the webpage is designed with a background image and is accompanied by a professional-looking copyright notice at the bottom. The overall codebase of this project demonstrates an excellent usage of modern web development technologies to create a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing website.
